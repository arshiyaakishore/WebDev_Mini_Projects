The code inside setInterval is executed every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
This function will continuously update the clock every second.


Getting HTML Elements
hours, minutes, seconds, ampm: These variables hold the elements that display the digital time.
hh, mm, ss: These variables hold the elements that display the circular indicators for hours, minutes, and seconds.
dotH, dotM, dotS: These variables hold the dot elements that rotate to indicate hours, minutes, and seconds.


Getting Current Time
h, m, s: These variables hold the current hours, minutes, and seconds obtained from the Date object.
ap: This variable determines whether it is AM or PM based on the current hour.



Convert to 12-hour Format
If the hour (h) is greater than 12, it is converted to 12-hour format by subtracting 12.
Leading zeros are added to hours, minutes, and seconds if they are single digits.


Update Digital Clock
The inner HTML of hours, minutes, seconds, and ampm is updated to display the current time.


Update Circular Indicators
The strokeDashoffset property of hh, mm, and ss is set to visually indicate the passage of time.
strokeDashoffset creates the effect of the circles being drawn from 0 to full.


Update Dot Indicators
The transform property of dotH, dotM, and dotS is set to rotate the dots based on the current time.
Each hour is represented by 30 degrees (360/12).
Each minute and second are represented by 6 degrees (360/60).
